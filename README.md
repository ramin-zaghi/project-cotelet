## Project Cotelet: Write real code without coding.
[Cotelet on GitHub](https://github.com/ramin-zaghi/project-cotelet/)

This project is codenamed Cotelet which is short for _COde-TEmplate-LET_.
It is to provide a software development tool aimed at both beginners and
professionals who are either learning a new programming language and/or
software library/framework/API (such as C/C++, Python, Java, C#, etc.) or
looking to speed up their prototyping and development cycles in creating
new software.

The aim is to make a _Rapid Application Development_ (RAD) _Integrated
Development Environment_ (IDE) that not only provides the usual featurs
of a RAD IDE (such as drag and drop features seen in almost all
_GUI_ design tools) but also to generate the source code [corresponding to
what is designed] that can be run or deployed totally independent of
this software.

This would therefore enable anyone to prototype, kickstart or even fully
develop their Apps, Games or other types of software and deploy or
to [re]use the generated source code (the output of this software) without
requiring any components of this software to be present on the target
machine to which the final product or the generated source code will
be deployed.
